      My published projects on github.io:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/wirt/">wirt</a>: image resizing tool, set the parameters,
        drop the image, you get your resized image back (originally created
        to render Google Sheets chart SVGs in higher resolution)</li>
      <li><a href="/imagebox/">imagebox</a>: crops the solid area around pictures
        and extends the borders automatically, making them look centered with
        a nice margin (Dart version of autocrop)</li>
      <li><a href="/imagerocket/">imagerocket</a>: supposed to be a complete rewrite
        of imagebox, but more like imagebox on steroids, however the UX is not the best
        and it's not fully functional yet</li>
      <li><a href="/calbox/">calbox</a>: a calculator with five operators (+, -,
        *, /, **), parentheses and variables</li>
      <li><a href="/rawurl/">rawurl</a>: if you want to send a URL to somebody, but
        they will blindly copy whatever redirection link the given platform throws
        at them, you can enter it here, and they can open the webpage to copy the
        URL as you intended</li>
      <li><a href="/carp/">carp</a>: camera warp effect</li>
      <li><a href="/mirror/">mirror</a>: displays whatever the webcam sees</li>
      <li><a href="/ledcalc/">ledcalc</a>: calculates led current limiting
        resistors, and helps to choose the resistor</li>
      <li><a href="/autocrop/">autocrop</a>: old version of imagebox</li>
      <li><a href="/sudokubox/">sudokubox</a>: a sudoku game that does the basic
        elimination automatically</li>
      <li><a href="/lighting/">lighting</a>: IndexedDB example, calculates the amount
        of light needed for rooms depending on room type and size (based on
        values I've found on Wikipedia, I think)</li>
      <li><a href="/photogrid/">photogrid</a>: displays rule of thirds and golden ratio
        on images</li>
      <li><a href="/audiopic/">audiopic</a>: a friend of mine doesn't have the right
        to install anything on his computer, so I've made something that can encode
        an image and an audio file into a video (works much better on Firefox,
        sadly Chrome is garbage)</li>
      <li><a href="/ccjegyzet/">ccjegyzet</a>: C++ notes I wrote in Hungarian for students /
        <span lang="hu">magyar nyelvű C++ jegyzet a nyelvet tanulóknak</span></li>
      <li><a href="/cc-adv/">cc-adv</a>: just some notes about C++ in Hungarian I've never finished /
        <span lang="hu">haladó C++ jegyzet, aminek nem jutottam a végére</span></li>
      <li><a href="/ledlayout/">ledlayout</a>: a personal project of mine
        to develop a LED based Dominican rosary, helping me with where to put
        the LEDs, and a basic program to test and troubleshoot the program
        before I start development on real hardware</li>
      </ul>
